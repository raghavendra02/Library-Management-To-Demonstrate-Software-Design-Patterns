# Library-Management-To-Demonstrate-Software-Design-Patterns

# INTRODUCTION
The library management project is a comprehensive software solution that aims to provide a streamlined and efficient system for managing the day-to-day operations of a library. The project was designed and developed using Java programming language with the help of Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and implemented with the help of various design patterns including creational, structural, and behavioural patterns.
The main objective of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for library staff to manage the library's resources, including books, and borrowings. The system also allows for tracking the availability and status of books, as well as keeping track of borrowing history and due dates.
The project's design was developed using MVC architecture, which separates the system's components into three distinct layers: Model, View, and Controller.  The project also implemented several design patterns to ensure its scalability, reusability, and maintainability. These include the Singleton pattern, which was used to ensure a single instance of the database connection throughout the project's runtime, as well as the Factory pattern, which was used to create instances of database access objects.

# PROBLEM DEFINITION
Libraries are an essential part of educational and cultural institutions, providing access to information and resources for learning, research, and leisure. However, managing a library's resources can be a complex and time-consuming task, especially for larger libraries with extensive collections.
One of the significant challenges faced by libraries is keeping track of their resources, including books, journals, and other materials. Libraries must also manage patrons' borrowing activity, including loan periods, renewals, and overdue fines.
Traditional methods of managing library resources, such as manual record-keeping and paper-based systems, can be inefficient and error-prone, leading to lost or misplaced books and inaccurate records. Additionally, such systems can make it challenging to keep track of overdue books, resulting in lost revenue and reduced user satisfaction.
Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive and efficient software solution to manage library resources, including books, patrons, and borrowing activity. This project aims to provide a solution to this problem by implementing a library management system using Java programming language with the help of Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and implemented with the help of various design patterns including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.
